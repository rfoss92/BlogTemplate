This is a template I made for a simple blog site.
It contains a home page, a page to write a post, and a page for viewing all the posts.
The live version on GitHub Pages doesn't not support MySQL, so you will not be able to actually create a post.

The technologies used are HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.
